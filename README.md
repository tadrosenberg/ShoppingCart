# Shopping cart with Node and Express

In this lab you will create a small piece of a grocery store. Your site will
display a list of groceries and enable a user to add items to a shopping cart.

This lab consists of two parts:

- [Part 1](./part1.md): In part one you will build and test the portion of the
  back end that handles products.

- [Part 2](./part2.md): In part two you will build and test the portion of the
  back end that handles the shopping cart.

- [Part 3](./part3.md): In part three, you will build and test portion of the
  front end that displays products.

- [Part 4](./part4.md): In part four, you will build and test portion of the
  front end that handles the shopping cart.
